# Flutter Unit Test Project

This is a Flutter project that demonstrates the usage of unit tests to ensure the correctness of your application's code.

## Overview

Unit testing is an essential practice in software development that helps catch bugs early, improves code quality, and facilitates refactoring. In this project, we have implemented unit tests for various components of a Flutter application using the `test` package provided by Flutter.
